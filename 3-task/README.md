### UUID

A very handy library for generating unique id. In my opinion, it would be great to have a built-in similar id generator in the language.

### Working with arrays like in Python

For example: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

####ex1 = arr[3:8] // [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
####ex2 = arr[5:]  // [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
####ex3 = arr[:5]  // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
####ex4 = arr[:]   // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
####ex5 = arr[:-3] // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
